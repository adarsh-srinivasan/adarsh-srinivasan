  â€‰Closed form expressions for the domination number of an $n \times m$ grid
  have attracted significant attention, and an exact expression has been
  obtained in 2011 by Goncalves et al. In this paper, we present our results on
  obtaining new lower bounds on the connected domination number of an $n \times
  m$ grid. The problem has been solved for grids with up to $4$ rows and with
  $6$ rows by Tolouse et al and the best currently known lower bound for
  arbitrary $m,n$ is $\lceil\frac{mn}{3}\rceil$. Fujie came up with a general
  construction for a connected dominating set of an $n \times m$ grid of size
  $\min \lbrace 2n+(m-4)+\lfloor\frac{m-4}{3}\rfloor(n-2),
  2m+(n-4)+\lfloor\frac{n-4}{3}\rfloor(m-2) \rbrace$ . In this paper, we
  investigate whether this construction is indeed optimum. We prove a new lower
  bound of $\left\lceil\frac{mn+2\lceil\frac{\min \{m,n\}}{3}\rceil}{3}
  \right\rceil$ for arbitrary $m,n \geq 4$.
