abstract: Closed form expressions for the domination number of an $n \times m$
  grid have attracted significant attention, and an exact expression has been
  obtained in 2011~\cite{griddomset1}. In this paper, we present our results on
  obtaining new lower bounds on the connected domination number of an $n \times
  m$ grid. The problem has been solved for grids with up to $4$ rows and with
  $6$ rows and the best currently known lower bound for arbitrary $m,n$ is
  $\ceil*{\frac{mn}{3}}$~\cite{gridbounds}. Fujie~\cite{FUJIE20031931} came up
  with a general construction for a connected dominating set of an $n \times m$
  grid. In this paper, we investigate whether this construction is indeed
  optimum. We prove a new lower bound of $\ceil*{\frac{mn+2\ceil*{\frac{\min
  \{m,n\}}{3}}}{3}}$ for arbitrary $m,n \geq 4$.
