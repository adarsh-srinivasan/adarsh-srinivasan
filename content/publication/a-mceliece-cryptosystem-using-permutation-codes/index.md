abstract: "This paper is an attempt to build a new public-key cryptosystem;
  similar to the McEliece cryptosystem, using permutation error-correcting
  codes. We study a public-key cryptosystem built using two permutation
  error-correcting codes. We show that these cryptosystems are insecure.
  However, the general framework in these cryptosystems can use any permutation
  error-correcting code and is interesting. "
