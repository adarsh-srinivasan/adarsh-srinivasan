abstract: In this thesis, we study some computational problems in permutation
  group theory and their applications to public-key cryptography. The primary
  goal of this thesis is to come up with a cryptosystem similar to the McEliece
  cryptosystem using permutation groups instead of vector spaces over finite
  fields. Like vector spaces, permutation groups too have been explored as a
  setting for error-correcting codes. These objects are called permutation
  codes. We propose a framework for such a cryptosystem and also come up with
  several classical attacks on it. We prove that the cryptosystem using
  transitive permutation groups is quantum-secure. We also explore using the
  permutation codes proposed by Bailey and Cameron in our cryptosystem. Although
  our cryptosystem using permutation codes that exist currently is insecure, we
  hope that this work would encourage research on coming up with new classes of
  permutation codes with efficient decoding algorithms.
